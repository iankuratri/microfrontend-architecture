# What are microfrontends?

Micro-frontend architecture is a design approach in which a front-end app is decomposed into individual, semi-independent “microapps” working loosely together.

The micro-frontend concept is vaguely inspired by, and named after, microservices.

- Divide a monolithic app into multiple, smaller apps.
- Each smaller app is responsible for a distinct feature of the product.

## Why use them?

- Multiple engineering teams can work in isolation.
- Each smaller app is easier to understand and to make changes.
